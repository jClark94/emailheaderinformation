Dear Joshua,

I would love to come to dinner on Sunday. Just a reminder in case James has=
n't circulated the dietary requirements - I'm vegetarian and allergic to ci=
trus fruit and chocolate.

Best wishes,

Natalie

Dear all,

Simon and I would like to request the pleasure of your company this Sunday =
evening in the Hollins Room for dinner.

Please let us know as soon as possible if you will be able to join us, for =
all or part of the evening.

Additionally, as the shopping, preparing, and cooking itself are tiring pro=
cesses, we would particularly appreciate it if a few of you would be genero=
us enough to give us a hand with the laying of the table and a few extra vo=
lunteers to help clear up at the end, we would be grateful. Please get back=
 to us us to let us know if you can help with these.

Regards,
--
Joshua and Simon
